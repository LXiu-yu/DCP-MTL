# Dataset
The dataset we have hosted to zenodo for release, more details about the dataset will be announced as soon as the paper is published!(https://zenodo.org/records/13734698)
This paper introduces the first UHR UAV dataset specifically for CFP, designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in identifying these parcels. The dataset offers ultra-high spatial resolution, various field parcel types, and broad geographic coverage.
