DCP-MTL: Vectorization of Agricultural Cultivation Field Parcels via Boundary-Parcel Multi-Task Learning Network in Ultra-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images

# Dataset
The dataset we have hosted to zenodo for release, more details about the dataset will be announced as soon as the paper is published!
This paper introduces the first UHR UAV dataset specifically for CFP, designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in identifying these parcels. The dataset offers ultra-high spatial resolution, various field parcel types, and broad geographic coverage.
